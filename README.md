Welcome to the Simon Game project! This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds, testing their memory and attention. This project was a fun and engaging way to apply my web development skills, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it!

Features :: 
1.	Interactive Gameplay: 
The game includes four colored buttons (red, blue, green, yellow) that light up and play a sound in a specific sequence.

2.	Random Sequence Generation:
Each round, a new color is added to the sequence, making the game progressively more challenging.

3.	User Input Handling:
Players must repeat the sequence correctly to advance to the next round.

4.	Sound Effects: 
Each button plays a unique sound, enhancing the gaming experience.

5.	Responsive Design:
The game is designed to be played on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

•	How to Play :: 
1.	Start the Game: Press any key to start the game. The game will begin by flashing a color and playing a sound.
2.	Repeat the Sequence: Click the buttons in the order of the sequence presented. Each round, a new color will be added to the sequence.
3.	Advance Levels: Successfully repeat the sequence to advance to the next level. The game continues to add one new color to the sequence each round.
4.	Game Over: If you click the wrong button, the game will reset, and you'll have to start over from the beginning.

•	Technologies Used ::
1.	HTML: Provides the structure of the game.
2.	CSS: Styles the game to make it visually appealing and responsive.
3.	JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including sequence generation, user input handling, and sound effects.
